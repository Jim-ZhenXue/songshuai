<p>Multi-output learning [1][13] aims to predict multiple outputs for an input, where the output values are characterized by diverse data types, such as binary, nominal, ordinal and real-valued variables. Such learning tasks arise in a variety of real-world applications, ranging from document classification, computer emulation, sensor network analysis, concept-based information retrieval, human action/causal induction, to video analysis, image annotation/retrieval, gene function prediction and brain science. Due to its popularity in applications, multi-output learning has also been widely explored in machine learning community, such as multi-label/multi-class classification [2][8], multi-target regression, hierarchical classification with class taxonomies, label sequence learning, sequence alignment learning, and supervised grammar learning, and so on.</p>

<p>The theoretical properties of existing approaches for multi-output data are still not well understood. This triggers practitioners to develop novel methodologies [5][9][11] and theories [3] to deeply understand multi-output learning tasks. Moreover, the emerging trends of ultrahigh input and output dimensionality [7], and the complexly structured objects [4], lead to formidable challenges for multi-output learning. Therefore, it is imperative to propose practical mechanisms and efficient optimization algorithms [8][10][12] for large-scale applications. Deep learning has gained much popularity in today’s research, and has been developed in recent years to deal with multi-label and multi-class classification problems. However, it remains non-trivial for practitioners to design novel deep neural networks [6] that are appropriate for more comprehensive multi-output learning domains.</p>

<h1 id="submission-guidelines">Submission Guidelines</h1>

<p>Workshop submissions and camera ready versions will be handled by Microsoft CMT. Click <a href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ACMLMoL2018">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ACMLMoL2018</a> for submission.</p>

<p>Papers should be formatted according to the ACML formatting instructions for the Conference Track. The submissions with 2 pages will be considered for the poster, while submissions with at least 6 pages will be considered for the oral presentation. The selective oral papers will be invited for IEEE TNNLS Special Issue on “Structured Multi-output Learning: Modelling, Algorithm, Theory and Applications” (<a href="https://cis.ieee.org/images/files/Documents/Transactions/TNNLS/TNNLS_SMLMATA-CFP.pdf">https://cis.ieee.org/images/files/Documents/Transactions/TNNLS/TNNLS_SMLMATA-CFP.pdf</a>).</p>

<p>ACML-MoL is a non-archival venue and there will be no published proceedings. The papers will be posted on the workshop website. It will be possible to submit to other conferences and journals both in parallel to and after ACML-MoL’18. Besides, we also welcome submissions to ACML-MoL that are under review at other conferences and workshops.</p>

<p>At least one author from each accepted paper must register for the workshop. Please see the ACML 2018 Website for information about accommodation and registration.</p>
